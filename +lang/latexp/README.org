* latexp layer
Additions/improvements for ~latex~ layer of Spacemacs.
- Functionality to quickly toggle between =$...$= and =\[...\]= math delimiters
- Functionality to disable prompts for a LaTeX command; e.g., use
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (latexp/TeX-disable-prompt-for-command "View")
  #+END_SRC
  to make ~auctex~ always select the default viewer
- Basic VIM-style navigation in =reftex-toc-mode= and =reftex-select-label-mode=
- Integrates [[https://github.com/iyefrat/evil-tex][evil-tex]] to add LaTeX-specific text objects
- Additional keybindings

** Keybindings
All commands that insert environments modify the current environment when
prefixed with =SPC u=.
