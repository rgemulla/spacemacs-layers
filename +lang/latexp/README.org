* latexp layer
Additions/improvements for ~latex~ layer of Spacemacs.
- Functionality to quickly toggle between =$...$= and =\[...\]= math delimiters
- Functionality to disable prompts for a LaTeX command; e.g., use
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (latexp/TeX-disable-prompt-for-command "View")
  #+END_SRC
  to make ~auctex~ always select the default viewer
- Additional keybindings
