* orgp layer
Additions/improvements for ~org~ layer of [[http:spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]].
- Integrated packages
  - [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw][calfw]] calendar framework
  - [[https://github.com/Malabarba/org-agenda-property][org-agenda-property]] to display properties in the agenda buffer
  - [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]] to query org files
  - [[https://github.com/alphapapa/helm-org-rifle][helm-org-rifle]] to quickly search through org files even when ~ivy~ layer is
    used (i.e., works without using the ~helm~ layer; ~orgp~ needs to be loaded
    after ~org~ for this to work)
- Show associated timestamp of a headline in the breadcrumb
- Various customizations for the agenda view
  - Functionality to apply custom faces for each tag in the agenda view
  - Functionality to add a pagebreak before each new data in the agenda view
  - Functionality to disable mouse-over faces in the agenda view
  - Functionality to hide time grid lines that overlap with an appointment (see
    layer variable =orgp/org-agenda-time-grid-hide-when-appointment=)
  - Custom comparator to sort agenda items such that full-day events come first,
    then events with a timestamp, then the TODO items
- When selecting a date using =org-read-date=, show/hide diary view for
  selected day via =!=
- Processing of src blocks
  - Functionality to tangle a single src block to a file
  - Functionality to copy a single src block to kill ring
  - Functionality to tangle all src blocks in a subtree to a file
  - Let ~org-babel~ execute =bat= code blocks (using =cmdproxy.exe=)
- Functionality to export the current subtree to a temporary HTML file for
  inclusion elsewhere (see =orgp/org-subtree-htmlize-to-temp-file=)
- Functionality to yank the current subtree without ID properties
- Functionality to yank/paste table at point in various formats (org, csv, tsv)
- More useful return key for Evil
  - in insert mode, use =evil-org-return=
  - in normal mode, use =org-open-at-point= when point is on a link, else use
    =evil-ret=
- Add support for ~callto~ links
- Integration with [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]]
  - Support for links to Zotero items
  - Export an org-mode link from Zotero (see comments in [[file:local/Org%20Link.js][Org Link.js]])
  - Export an org-mode item from Zotero (see comments in [[file:local/Org%20Entry.js][Org Entry.js]]),
    including a link to the Zotero item and a suitable setting of the
    attachment folder
- Modifies [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sticky-header][org-sticky-header]] to show full path unfontified in header line
  (enable with layer variable =org-enable-sticky-header=)
- Additional keybindings
  - Quickly reveal things around point
  - Access to ~org-babel~
  - Quicker timestamp changes in agenda view

** Customizations for agenda view
Disabled by default. Example usage:

;; enable the above hook
(add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook 'my/org-agenda-finalize-hook t)

;; show page breaks as horizontal lines
